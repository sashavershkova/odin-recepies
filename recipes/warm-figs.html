    <h1>Warm Figs with Goat Cheese and Honey recipe</h1>

    <h4>Exquisite yet easy to make warm figs.</h4>
    <p>We make an ultrasimple fruit dessert by pairing fresh figs with tangy goat cheese and toasted walnuts. A piece of barely enhanced fresh fruit is a common ending to many Mediterranean meals, and figs are a perfect candidate: Their sweet, juicy flesh and delicate flavor need little adornment. We started by choosing the ripest, plumpest figs we could find. Halving them and topping them with a bit of tangy goat cheese offset their sweetness nicely. A brief stint in a hot oven was enough to warm the figs and cheese through, and topping each one with a walnut half, toasted to bring out its flavor, offered pleasant crunchy contrast. Finally, a drizzle of honey (tasters preferred milder-flavored options like clover) brought all the elements together with a hit of floral sweetness.</p>
